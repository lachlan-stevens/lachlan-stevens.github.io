                            <h1>Self Diagnosis? A bit about my personal profile</h1>
                            <h2>Myers-Briggs Results</h2>
                            <p>I've actually done the Myers-Briggs a few times before through 16personalities.com, and I've found it quite helpful to understand some of my natural behaviours and the way I react to certain situations. I fit into the personality of Logician (INTP), notably with a very high level of introversion but close to 50/50 on Perceiving and Judging (in fact when I first did the test a number of years ago I was actually an INTJ).</p>
                            <p>While I don't 100% fit into everything 16personalities.com states about my personality type (for example, I tend to be a stickler for rules and being punctual, unlike the typical Logician), however being aware of my weaknesses has especially helped me grow at work - I'm particularly careful of seeming insensitive or condescending, which can be typical of my personality type.</p>
                            <p>Most information I can find on career paths for logicians points programming and IT being an ideal career path for this personality type.</p>
                            <h2>VARK Learning Style Results</h2>
                            <p>I've completed the VARK questionnaire, which has established me as a very strongly kinaesthetic learner. This isn't at all a surprise to me. While I find value in reviewing written materials of value I need to be able to physically put something into practice in real life situations to be able to take my programming skills to the next level. I'm currently working primarily in a non-technical role at present, so I've found it really hard to maintain skills doing my own self-paced learning, in that I'm not working towards something tangible or larger.</p>
                            <h2>The Four Tendencies</h2>
                            <p>For my third test I searched far and wide for an interesting test that would not only be useful for the purpose of this assignment but also to better understand myself better. In my search I came across a fairly recently released book called The Four Tendencies by Gretchen Rubin. The Four Tendencies is also about how people respond to expectations - that is both outer expectations (those set by others) and inner expectations (those set internally by yourself). My expectation from reviewing the information available on the test on the author's website led me to believe that I'd likely fall into the role of a Questioner - that is someone who questions all expectations, and meets these expectations if they make sense.</p>
                            <p>This expectation was confirmed when completing the test. Of course, similarly to MBTI results above, placing a personality within a finite number of category is rife with generalisations. The test results speak about the Questioners struggle to follow rules such as road rules "just because", and require some sort of justification to do so. When I look at laws, safety requirements and the like I am more than happy to follow these sort of things just because they are there.</p>
                            <p>It's more when looking at more work related decisions where the questioning side comes out. This can be both a great and frustrating thing for a manager or employer. If I believe an approach being taken is not the best approach, whether in terms of outcomes, compliance, or value for money I will take the time to gather data to support this and present this to a manager. However I've more than once gotten on the wrong side of people by doing so as it can appear as though I'm not a team player, even though internally I believe what I am doing is all about ensuring a team's success.</p>
                            <p>There's also what's termed as analysis-paralysis, where making a decision is pushed further and further back in search for more information to support a decision or outcome. This is something I definitely know the feeling of - in fact myself and my partner have been putting together a side hustle idea for what seems like a decade, however I can't quite pass my internal goalposts to be able to push the button and go live.</p>
