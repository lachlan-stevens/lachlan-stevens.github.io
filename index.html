                <p>Hi! I’m Lachlan. I’m 28 years old and living in Sydney, Australia, though I grew up a little further north in Newcastle. I might seem a little bit old to be starting a degree, however this isn’t my first foray in to tertiary education. Over the years I’ve completed a fair portion of a Bachelor of Communications, a little bit of a Bachelor of Business, and have a few TAFE-level certificates to top it off.</p>
                <p>In my free time I enjoy hanging out with my two partner and our two cats. When she’s finally able to leave the country (Visa issues!) we’d love to take a trip to the USA and Canada to visit my sister and her family.</p>
                <h2>My Interest in IT</h2>
                <p>I’ve had a lifelong interest in all things geeky and techy. You might then ask, why didn’t I just study IT to start with? For many years I was of the opinion that you shouldn’t do something you love for work, or you wouldn’t love it anymore. After a decade in the workforce, you tend to change your mind on these things, I guess.</p>
                <p>My earliest memory of my interest in IT would have to be modding games I played as a child. At first it was simple things like changing .ini files, however some of the later work I did was releasing small mods for games like TTD and Red Alert 2. TTD was a particular interesting experience, as almost all of coding was done in barely human readable hexadecimal code. These days I work with things a little more on the mainstream side of things. In my free time I’ve learnt Python, VBA, SQL, HTML/CSS/JS, a tiny bit of PHP, and a fair bit of C# (based around ASP.NET Core and also the Unity game engine).</p>
                <p>I made the decision to study through RMIT because based on the courses offered, it seemed like a nice generalist IT degree that offered plenty of opportunity at the end for further learning and specialisation, both through post-graduate study and self-directed study while in the industry.</p>
                <p>I don’t take the fact I already have a few skills in programming for granted whatsoever in my approach to this degree. While there’s definite advantages to having a pre-existing knowledge foundation to build on, I see definite disadvantages, too. Due to pretty all of my knowledge having been built up through free online courses and LinkedIn Premium/Lynda, there haven’t really been overall principles guiding the process like there would be when studying a university degree. I’m sure plenty of the skills I’ve learnt weren’t really taught in the most technically correct way they could be. So while I’m certainly excited to acquire brand new skills, it’s really important I don’t discount going over things I already know, and put in the effort to re-align my existing skills with the industry and language-specific best practices.</p>

                <h1>My Ideal IT Job</h1>
                <img class="img-left" src="img/ideal-job.png" alt="A job description for a mid level .NET Developer job">
                <p>It was pretty tricky to find an ideal job. Obviously, a lot of talent acquisition within the informational technology field is done through recruitment agencies. A really important part of looking at potential jobs for me is not only the position description itself but also the sort of organisation itself. With the heavy reliance on the recruitment industry within IT, it's a little more tricky to get an idea of who you're looking at working for.</p>
                <p>Regardless, I've done my best to find a good listing that combined my interests and existing skills with those I'm looking to further invest in.</p>
                <p>This job listing for a mid level .Net Developer appears heavily based around developing dynamic web content using Microsoft's ASP.Net Core technology. The addition of Umbraco, an open source CMS engine built using ASP.Net, and Xamarin in the job listing as a beneficial skill is interesting, and points toward quite a diverse service offering from the company. I find this job appealing as it's centred around C# which is a language I'm very interested in, and heavily involved around ASP.Net Core MVC, which I enjoy working with.</p>
                <p>The essential skills of the role are heavily based around backend .Net development and devops principles, with heavy C# knowledge underpinning a fair portion of the other beneficial skills as well. Javascript comes in second on the list, and I'd speculate it's listed as prominently as it is not only for its importance within the frontend sphere, but more specifically around AJAX to tie back into the ASP.Net Core back end. Some sort of an RDMS is a must for any sort of data-driven application, and the hiring company's preferred flavour is SQL Server. The remainder of the essential skills are focussed on the dev ops side of things, including unit testing and integration.</p>
                <p>In terms of my own skills, I have a decent handle on the coding side of things, with at least a foundational understanding of C#, JS, SQL and CSS, which I've picked up mostly from my own self-directed learning from a multitude of different sources, including Microsoft Virtual Academy, LinkedIn Premium/Lynda and some other tutorial-style websites. My main focus in terms of these would be further building on these skills and developing further skills.</p>
                <p>In terms of my plan going forward, I'm left in an interesting situation as RMIT and the other institutions offering courses under the OUA banner don't appear to offer any specific .Net or ASP related-learning(there is course CPT373 which appears highly relevant, however it doesn't appear to be offered currently according to the OUA website), so much of my continued development towards this type of job would need to be self-directed. Luckily by virtue of being a language developed by Microsoft, there is a wealth of knowledge available around C#, .NET and ASP.NET.</p>
                <p>Regardless of the above, there's still plenty of relevant courses offered by RMIT that offer transferrable skills that would be incredibly handy to the sort of role above. I've identified the following as key courses:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>CPT222 - Software Architecture: Design and Implementation: this particular course appears to offer specific focus on MVC patterns using Java, testing and design patterns generally.</li>
                    <li>CPT230 - Software Engineering Fundamentals: this course appears to lean heavily toward devops and general development skills. While UML isn't specifically mentioned in the job advertisement, working on any complex web application requires a team to be able to speak in the same language when planning and conceptualising, and UML is a great way to do this. The course also covers off Design Patterns and Testing again, similar to CPT222.</li>
                    <li>CPT330 - Software Engineering Project Management: this course dives deeper into the business of software development - looking at different software development methodologies, and further diving into testing and quality assurance.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Through the Lynda.com library offered through RMIT, there are a number of useful courses that will be helpful as well:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>C# Design Patterns with Reynald Adolphe - these three courses appear extremely useful to developing a good understanding of Design Pattern Principles.</li>
                    <li>Become a DevOps Engineer (learning path) - this learning path covers a large number of different technologies relevant for devops work, with special mention to CI/CD as required in the job listing, Docker which is commonly used with ASP.NET applications and Lean and Agile methodologies.</li>
                </ul>

                <h1>Self Diagnosis? A bit about my personal profile</h1>
                <h2>Myers-Briggs Results</h2>
                <p>I've actually done the Myers-Briggs a few times before through 16personalities.com, and I've found it quite helpful to understand some of my natural behaviours and the way I react to certain situations. I fit into the personality of Logician (INTP), notably with a very high level of introversion but close to 50/50 on Perceiving and Judging (in fact when I first did the test a number of years ago I was actually an INTJ).</p>
                <p>While I don't 100% fit into everything 16personalities.com states about my personality type (for example, I tend to be a stickler for rules and being punctual, unlike the typical Logician), however being aware of my weaknesses has especially helped me grow at work - I'm particularly careful of seeming insensitive or condescending, which can be typical of my personality type.</p>
                <p>Most information I can find on career paths for logicians points programming and IT being an ideal career path for this personality type.</p>
                <h2>VARK Learning Style Results</h2>
                <p>I've completed the VARK questionnaire, which has established me as a very strongly kinaesthetic learner. This isn't at all a surprise to me. While I find value in reviewing written materials of value I need to be able to physically put something into practice in real life situations to be able to take my programming skills to the next level. I'm currently working primarily in a non-technical role at present, so I've found it really hard to maintain skills doing my own self-paced learning, in that I'm not working towards something tangible or larger.</p>
                <h2>The Four Tendencies</h2>
                <p>For my third test I searched far and wide for an interesting test that would not only be useful for the purpose of this assignment but also to better understand myself better. In my search I came across a fairly recently released book called The Four Tendencies by Gretchen Rubin. The Four Tendencies is also about how people respond to expectations - that is both outer expectations (those set by others) and inner expectations (those set internally by yourself). My expectation from reviewing the information available on the test on the author's website led me to believe that I'd likely fall into the role of a Questioner - that is someone who questions all expectations, and meets these expectations if they make sense.</p>
                <p>This expectation was confirmed when completing the test. Of course, similarly to MBTI results above, placing a personality within a finite number of category is rife with generalisations. The test results speak about the Questioners struggle to follow rules such as road rules "just because", and require some sort of justification to do so. When I look at laws, safety requirements and the like I am more than happy to follow these sort of things just because they are there.</p>
                <p>It's more when looking at more work related decisions where the questioning side comes out. This can be both a great and frustrating thing for a manager or employer. If I believe an approach being taken is not the best approach, whether in terms of outcomes, compliance, or value for money I will take the time to gather data to support this and present this to a manager. However I've more than once gotten on the wrong side of people by doing so as it can appear as though I'm not a team player, even though internally I believe what I am doing is all about ensuring a team's success.</p>
                <p>There's also what's termed as analysis-paralysis, where making a decision is pushed further and further back in search for more information to support a decision or outcome. This is something I definitely know the feeling of - in fact myself and my partner have been putting together a side hustle idea for what seems like a decade, however I can't quite pass my internal goalposts to be able to push the button and go live.</p>

            <section id="project-idea">
                <h1>While You're There - A Smartphone App</h1>
                <p>Ever find yourself thinking, or saying to your partner, "next time I'm at the supermarket, I must remember to pick that up"? If you're like me, you promptly forget about this item you're in need of until you next think of it while sitting at home. While You're There is an application that will aim to alleviate that. When you're sitting at home or at work and think of that slightly left of field item that you need to pick up, simply open up While You're There and enter the item in. When you’re out and about and pass by a location that might sell that item, you received a push notification from the app letting you know you know you wanted to pick up the item and where the system thinks the item might live.</p>
                <p>The motivation behind this project is simple - it's an issue a lot of people have. I know certainly for me it's a common occurrence to leave a shopping centre and be five minutes from home when myself or my partner exclaims "Damnit, we should have gotten batteries while we were at the shops!"</p>
                <p>While You're There will be a smartphone app which allows the user to enter items they wish to purchase next time they're near a store. The item could be something simple like a loaf of bread, to something a little more niche that they might need to visit a particular or more specialised store for. The app would also allow the user to set up a group, where they and their partner or members of their household can enter items which will update a shared list accessible to anyone.</p>
                <p>Once the item has been entered into the app, the data will be returned to a centralised database which will push updates to any other users which are members of the same shopping list.</p>
                <p>Running in the background, the app will regularly check the user's location (the preference would be to use the user's low accuracy location for privacy reasons, but testing would need to be done to confirm if this is feasible). If the user was close to a map location that was likely to sell the item the user was looking for, a push notification would display asking the user to pick up the item while they're there.</p>
                <img src="img/wyt-push-mockup.png" alt="A mock up of how a push notification from While You're There might look">
                <p>On an android phone, the push notification might look the picture above, providing the user a call to action to visit the store to purchase the item, while also providing the user the opportunity to indicate that the item wanted is not sold at the suggested location, or to snooze notifications from the app for a period of time. A possible further expansion of the app functionality might use the feedback provided by users that a particular map location does not sell a desired item to lessen the chance of that particular location being given as a suggestion to a different user in future.</p>
                <p>Once the user indicates either as a response to the push notification or through the app UI itself that they have purchased the item they needed, this update will be pushed back to the app's central database which will remove the listing from the shopping list on all accounts it is shared to.</p>
                <p>The app would also be capable of linking to Siri, Google Assistant and other voice services to create shopping list items.</p>
                <p>The app would derive its revenue through the use of small banner ads displayed within the application itself. Additionally, the free version of the app would limit the number of items able to be added to the shopping list, and the number of users to be added to a shared list (these limits would not be needlessly restrictive). If the user wished to have access to unlimited items and list members, they could either pay a small monthly subscription (along the lines of approximately $0.99) or could pay a slightly larger upfront free for lifetime unlocked usage ($4.99 or so). By either subscribing to the app or purchasing it one-off, advertising would also be removed from the app. This price structure is an example only and significant research has not been conducted into how attractive these price points would be or revenue difference between a direct payment and advertising revenue.</p>
                <p>In terms of technology, the app would be built as a Xamarin cross-platform application on Android and iOS. Utilising the razor templating engine would allow a more visually appealing and consistent visual approach between platforms, and potentially a browser-based implementation if this is considered later on. The backend database would be hosted as an Azure SQL Server, and backend functionality would be provided through an Azure App Service built in C#. Due to using a SaaS provider for the app's back end, no special hardware would be required to manage this functionality, and communication between the app and the server would primarily be through REST push.</p>
                <p>The primary skills relating to this project would be relating to .NET development, with the two main parts of this being Xamarin development for the application itself, and ASP.NET Core for development of Web API running on Azure. Front end design and development skills would also be necessary to build out the user interface of the application and to design things such as AJAX calls within the app and back home to the server to dynamically update data. It seems likely that it would be possible to develop these required skills to be able to develop the app in the near term, and there is ample talent available in the workforce to assist if required.</p>
                <p>If the project is successful, it would provide a handy application for users while providing a small revenue stream. Importantly, it would provide a great opportunity for me to develop pretty much all of the necessary and beneficial skills for the ideal job I mentioned earlier - indeed, if I was complete development of this app myself (no small feat in itself), this would largely satisfy most of the requirements of a mid-level .NET developer.</p>
