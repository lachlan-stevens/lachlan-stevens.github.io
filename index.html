                            <p>Hi! I’m Lachlan. I’m 28 years old and living in Sydney, Australia, though I grew up a little further north in Newcastle. I might seem a little bit old to be starting a degree, however this isn’t my first foray into tertiary education. Over the years I’ve completed a fair portion of a Bachelor of Communications, a little bit of a Bachelor of Business, and have a few TAFE-level certificates to top it off.</p>
                            <p>In my free time I enjoy hanging out with my partner and our two cats. We're in the midst of applying for a partner visa for at the moment, so she's not able to leave the country, but once this is all fixed up we’d love to take a trip to the USA and Canada to visit my sister and her family.</p>
                            <h2>My Interest in IT</h2>
                            <p>I’ve had a lifelong interest in all things geeky and techy. You might then ask, why didn’t I just study IT to start with? For many years I was of the opinion that you shouldn’t do something you love for work, or you wouldn’t love it anymore. After a decade in the workforce, you tend to change your mind on these things, I guess.</p>
                            <p>My earliest memory of my interest in IT would have to be modding games I played as a child. At first it was simple things like changing .ini files, however some of the later work I did was releasing small mods for games like TTD and Red Alert 2. TTD was a particular interesting experience, as almost all of coding was done in barely human readable hexadecimal code. These days I work with things a little more on the mainstream side of things. In my free time I’ve learnt Python, VBA, SQL, HTML/CSS/JS, a tiny bit of PHP, and a fair bit of C# (based around ASP.NET Core and also the Unity game engine).</p>
                            <p>I made the decision to study through RMIT because based on the courses offered, it seemed like a nice generalist IT degree that offered plenty of opportunity at the end for further learning and specialisation, both through post-graduate study and self-directed study while in the industry.</p>
                            <p>I don’t take the fact I already have a few skills in programming for granted whatsoever in my approach to this degree. While there’s definite advantages to having a pre-existing knowledge foundation to build on, I see definite disadvantages, too. Due to pretty much all of my knowledge having been built up through free online courses and LinkedIn Premium/Lynda, there haven’t really been overall principles guiding the process like there would be when studying a university degree. I’m sure plenty of the skills I’ve learnt weren’t really taught in the most technically correct way they could be. So while I’m certainly excited to acquire brand new skills, it’s really important I don’t discount going over things I already know, and put in the effort to re-align my existing skills with the industry and language-specific best practices.</p>
